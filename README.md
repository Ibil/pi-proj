- See list of added games should show game info from boardgame atlas

- db treat exceptions : FIXME and TODOS commentaries;
- In the app, the game details description has html code, see if it is required to render it without the tags or to read that as html and render html in-place;
- limpar dados introduzidos nos testes unitarios e de integracao.
- add "/api/" to api routes and remove "/app" routes from the app routes
